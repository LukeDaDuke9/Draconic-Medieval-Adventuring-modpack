# Draconic-Medieval-Adventuring-modpack

Draconic Adventures is intended to expand on adventuring, reimagine boss battles, and give the ability to dominate over all the known world while blasting the dungeons and towers of terror while riding your favorite mythical creature.

 Expect to have good/stable performance when 4.5 gb(4500MB) are allocated to this modpack. if lagges every few seconds or so, the allocate another 500MB

This modpack also includes the resoursepack of Excalibur and stoneborn to give Minecraft a medieval-inspired look.

Due to this being my very first modpack ever, There may be issues with it, See the issues tab above If any problems arise. I will be happy to help.

Start with only food and a wooden sword to win all the glory before the nitwits in the village get their own dragon and join forces with the pillagers!

Expect a server-pack file to be available soon!
